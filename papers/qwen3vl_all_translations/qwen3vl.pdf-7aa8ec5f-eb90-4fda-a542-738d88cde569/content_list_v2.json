                        "content": "We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision–language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency–quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and crossreferencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., Math-Vista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial–temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision–language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. To balance text-only and multimodal learning objectives, we apply square-root reweighting, which boosts multimodal performance without compromising text capabilities. We extend pretraining to a context length of 256K tokens and bifurcate post-training into non-thinking and thinking variants to address distinct application requirements. Furthermore, we allocate additional compute resources to the post-training phase to further enhance model performance. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows. "

We replace the absolute-time alignment via positional encoding used in Qwen2.5-VL with explicit timestamp tokens to mark frame groups, providing a simpler and more direct temporal representation. In addition, on the optimization side, we move from a per-sample loss to a square-root-normalized per-token loss, which better balances the contributions of text and multimodal data during training.

Beyond localizing objects, Qwen3-VL is trained to reason about spatial relationships, object affordances, and feasible actions in 2D scenes—capabilities essential for embodied AI and interactive applications. To this end, we construct a specialized dataset that goes beyond standard grounding by incorporating: (i) relational annotations (e.g., “the cup to the left of the laptop”), (ii) affordance labels (e.g., “graspable”, “pressable”, “sittable”), and (iii) action-conditioned queries that require planning (e.g., “What should I move first to reach the book behind the monitor?”). These samples are derived from both curated real-world scenes and synthetically generated layouts, with natural language queries automatically generated via templated and LLM-based methods to ensure diversity and complexity. Critically, all spatial references are expressed relative to other objects or scene frames, rather than absolute coordinates, encouraging robust relational reasoning. This training enables Qwen3-VL to not only answer “where” questions but also “how” and “what can be done” — forming a foundation for agentic interaction with visual environments. "

To further enhance the model’s ability to understand the physical world from images, we constructed a specialized pretraining dataset for 3D visual grounding. We sourced data from public collections of diverse indoor and outdoor scenes and reformulated it into a visual question-answering format. Each sample consists of: 1) a single-view camera image, 2) a natural language referring expression, and 3) the corresponding 9-DoF 3D bounding box annotations in a structured JSON format, specifying the object’s spatial position and semantic label. As the 3D bounding boxes are derived from multiple sensors and data sources, they exhibit varying camera intrinsic parameters and inherent noise. To this end, we filter out heavily occluded and inaccurate labels and follow Omni3D (Brazil et al., 2023) to unify all data into a virtual camera coordinate system. We also synthesized a large corpus of descriptive captions to create rich textual queries for 3D grounding. These descriptions go beyond naming the object’s category to include detailed attributes, layout arrangements, spatial location, visual affordances, and interactions with surrounding objects—yielding more fine-grained and grounded referring expressions.

(ii) Length-Adaptive Sampling: During pre-training stages, we dynamically adjust sampling parameters, such as frames per second (fps) and the maximum number of frames, according to different sequence length constraints. This adaptive strategy mitigates information loss associated with suboptimal sampling practices (e.g., overly sparse frame selection or excessively low spatial resolution), thus preserving visual details and optimizing training efficacy.

Building upon the foundational capabilities of Qwen2.5-VL, which is proficient in approximately eight core domains and 30 fine-grained subcategories, we have strategically expanded its functional scope. This expansion was achieved by integrating insights from community feedback, academic literature, and practical applications, facilitating the introduction of novel capabilities. These include, but are not limited to, spatial reasoning for embodied intelligence, image-grounded reasoning for fine-grained visual understanding, spatio-temporal grounding in videos for robust object tracking, and the comprehension of long-context technical documents spanning hundreds of pages. Guided by these target tasks and grounded in authentic use cases, we systematically curated the SFT dataset through the meticulous selection and synthesis of samples from open-source datasets and web resources. This targeted data engineering effort has been instrumental in establishing Qwen3-VL as a more comprehensive and robust multimodal foundation model. "

The integration of multimodal content is specifically designed to enable the model to interpret complex, real-world scenarios. To ensure global relevance, the dataset extends beyond its primary Chinese and English corpora to include a diverse set of multilingual samples, thereby broadening its linguistic coverage. Furthermore, it simulates realistic conversational dynamics by incorporating both single-turn and multiturn dialogues contextualized within various visual settings, from single-image to multi-image sequences. Crucially, the dataset also features interleaved image-text examples engineered to support advanced agentic behaviors, such as tool-augmented image search and visually-grounded reasoning. This heterogeneous data composition ensures comprehensive coverage and enhances the dataset’s representativeness for training generalizable and sophisticated multimodal agents. "

We employ mean Average Precision (mAP) as our evaluation metric. Each input is an image-text pair consisting of the image and a textual prompt specifying the object category. To ensure a fair comparison with existing VLMs, we set the IoU threshold to 0.15 and report mAP@0.15 on the Omni3D test set, with detection confidence fixed at 1.0. As shown in Table 2, our flagship Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B model consistently outperforms other closedsource models across multiple datasets. Specifically, on the SUN RGB-D dataset (Song et al., 2015), the Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking variants surpass the performance of Gemini-2.5-Pro by 5.2 points. Our smaller-scale variants (e.g., Qwen3-VL-30BA3B, -32B, -8B, -4B, -2B) also exhibit remarkably competitive performance in 3D object grounding, with detailed results provided in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

Across these benchmarks, the model showcases exceptional capabilities, rivaling the performance of top-tier models like Gemini-2.5-Pro, GPT-5, and Claude-Opus-4.1. This success is largely driven by the model’s profound spatial understanding, which stems from its training on high-resolution visual data with fine-grained pointing, relative-position annotations, and QA pairs. This capability is clearly validated by its strong results on EmbSpatial, RefSpatial, and RoboSpatialHome, where Qwen3-VL-235B-A22 achieves scores of 84.3, 69.9, and 73.9, respectively.

In comparison with state-of-the-art proprietary models — including Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.1, Qwen3-VL demonstrates competitive and, in several cases, superior performance. In particular, our flagship model, Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct, achieves performance on par with leading models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro (with a thinking budget of 128) and GPT-5 minimal on standard video understanding benchmarks. By extending the context window to 256K tokens, it further attains or even surpasses Gemini-2.5-Pro on long-video evaluation tasks, most notably on MLVU. "

Additionally, videos from Charades-STA were sampled at 4 frames per second (fps), while a rate of 2 fps was used for all other benchmarks. For VideoMMMU, we employed a model-based judge for evaluation, as rule-based scoring proved insufficiently accurate. It is worth noting that our comparison cannot guarantee full fairness due to resource and API limitations, which constrained the number of input frames used during evaluation: 512 for Gemini 2.5 Pro, 256 for GPT-5, and 100 for Claude Opus 4.1.
