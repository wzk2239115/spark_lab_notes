While this issue poses minimalconcern for models primarily designed for general chat, it represents a non-trivial challenge foragentic foundation models where function calling is a core capability. To mitigate this limitation,we propose a novel function call template that encapsulates function call keys and values withinXML-like special token tags.

Since the initial Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) has alreadyconditioned the model on generating 64K-length responses, introducing RL stages with shortermaximum lengths can cause the model to “unlearn” its long-context capabilities.

A temperature that is too low leads to convergent, less exploratoryoutputs, while one that is too high introduces low-quality, noisy samples, undermining both modelaccuracy and training efficiency. Using a fixed sampling temperature is suboptimal because it fails toadapt as the policy distribution becomes more concentrated (i.e., has lower entropy), often resultingin insufficient exploration at later stages. Therefore, we propose dynamically adjusting the samplingtemperature to maintain a healthy balance between accuracy and exploration. Specifically, whenthe average reward of rollouts stabilizes, we identify this as a convergence phase and increase thesampling temperature to encourage greater diversity. To mitigate the risk of introducing excessivenoise, we implement a quality-control mechanism: we periodically evaluate model performance on aheld-out validation set across a range of temperatures.

This benchmark enables a standardized and scalable evaluation of amodel’s ability to handle potentially harmful or sensitive topics. The categories include Ethics andMorality, Illegal Activities, Mental Health, Offensiveness, Physical Health, Privacy and Property, andUnfairness and Bias. We evaluated GLM-4.5 against a suite of other leading models. The resultsindicate that GLM-4.5 achieves a strong safety score, competitive with other top-tier models.

Notably,GLM-4.5 demonstrates robust performance in the areas of Ethics and Morality (94.33), Mental Health(94.67), and Physical Health (96.67). While it performs well in preventing responses related to IllegalActivities (90.97) and protecting Privacy and Property (92.00), there is still room for improvement inaddressing Unfairness and Bias, an area of ongoing focus for our development efforts. The detailedperformance breakdown is presented in the table below.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":16,"id":"b3e71910-0741-4632-85ea-14d816358428","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"16-6"},{"bbox":[105,624,290,635],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":7,"text":"# 4.3 Evaluations for Hands-on Experience","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":16,"id":"595321e8-3ebb-474c-b003-1162e91e97c2","page_size":[612,792],"block_position":"16-7"},{"bbox":[104,644,506,722],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":8,"text":"Sometimes, a trained LLM may overfit some predefined benchmarks, which makes the evaluatedresults not precisely reflect real-world experience.
